# DeckLib

Simple PCL library for a deck of cards. Basic Deck and Card objects, enums and various functions that could be handy for a simple game engine for card games.

Another purpose of this library is just to demonstrate some basic Unit Tests, and to include code coverage for my own benefit. This has mostly been done as a technical excersise, many of these unit tests are a bit more thorougher than might normally be done.

Aim is for this to be the starting point for a generic Card Game Engine for mobile devices that allows for very flexible and scalable games to be added easily to the project.
