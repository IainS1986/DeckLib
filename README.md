# DeckLib

Simple PCL library for a deck of cards. Basic Deck and Card objects, enums and various functions that could be handy for a simple game engine for card games.

Unit tests included to ensure stability of the library. Note - This has mostly been done as a technical excersise, many of these unit tests are a bit thorougher.

Aim is for this to be the starting point for a generic Card Game Engine for mobile devices that allows for very flexible and scalable games to be added easily to the project.
